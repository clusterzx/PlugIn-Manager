# PlugIn-Manager
Manage a DLL by Methods

You can open a managed DLL by path and it will retrieve all public classes and their public methods.
If you picked your method you can execute it by the loader. This repository is only for testing for a upcoming plugin system.

To load the form correctly compile the project before opening form in debugger. Its a known bug in ThemeBase and the IDE.
